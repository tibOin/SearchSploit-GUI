+ You're a hacker, a developer, an IT enthusiast or anyone who use the popular exploit database.
+ You work on Mac.
+ You like old school CLI interfaces but think GUIs are cool.

You came to the right place!

This tiny application is built on top of an existing installation of searchsploit 
and provide access to the local and remote database in a native macOS interface.        
It will feel more natural to search the exploit-database. 


## Capabilities
+ You can search the local database and see the result in a table view.
+ You can see details for selected exploits.
+ You can open the exploit file locally via your default text editor.
+ Or show the exploit page on exploit-db.com via your default browser.
+ The app supports interactions using the new Touch Bar on MacBook Pro.

## Requirements
+ macOS 10.13.x
+ 128Mb RAM min. :smirk:
